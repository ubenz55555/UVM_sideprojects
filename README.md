# UVM_sideprojects

The copy rights belongs to EDA playground(APB UVM With Scoreboard), I modify them for different UVM implementations.

The original code is under /original_code , the DUT.sv is under it, all of UVM examples share the same DUT.sv.

There will be descriptions of what I changed to make them work, they can be download and run directly, please feel free to use them!

compile options : -timescale=1ns/1ns +vcs+flush+all +warn=all -sverilog

run options : +UVM_TESTNAME=<your_test_name> +UVM_VERBOSITY=UVM_MEDIUM+ is_active=UVM_ACTIVE
